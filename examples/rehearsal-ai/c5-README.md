# C5: Claude Code Usage Documentation

## What is C5?

**C5 is the 5th level of architecture documentation** (after C4: Context, Container, Component, Code).

While **C4 documents "what can be done"** (design, capabilities, architecture), **C5 documents "what was actually done"** (execution, usage, automation history).

### The Problem C5 Solves

When developers "vibe code" with Claude Code:
- They create content using agents, skills, and MCPs
- The knowledge of HOW to do it lives in their head
- When they leave, new developers can't replicate the process
- Teams lose institutional knowledge about automation workflows

**C5 creates an "automation recipe book"** showing exactly which agents/skills/MCPs were used to create which content, with real examples and step-by-step workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start: How to Use C5

### For New Developers

1. **Identify what you want to create** (blog post, B-school page, etc.)
2. **Find the corresponding C5 document** (see navigation above)
3. **Follow the step-by-step workflow** in that document
4. **Run the agent command** (e.g., `/agent b-school-page-creator`)
5. **Review the generated content** and publish

### For Team Leads

Use C5 to:
- Onboard new developers instantly (no tribal knowledge needed)
- Standardize content creation workflows across team
- Track which automation tools are being used
- Identify opportunities for more automation

## 🛠️ Understanding the Workflow

### Typical Agent Workflow

1. **Research Phase** - Agent gathers data from MCPs (Reddit, Web Search, etc.)
2. **Content Creation Phase** - Agent uses skills to write/format content
3. **SEO Optimization Phase** - Agent optimizes for search engines
4. **Validation Phase** - Agent validates quality (Lighthouse audits, etc.)
5. **Output Phase** - Agent adds content to data files

### Skills vs MCPs

- **Skills** - Reusable capabilities (research, writing, SEO optimization)
- **MCPs** - External services (Reddit, Lighthouse, Web Search)
- **Agents** - Orchestrators that combine skills and MCPs

### Hooks

- **Git Pull Reminder** - Ensures you pull latest changes before editing
- **SEO Audit Trigger** - Automatically runs SEO audits after content changes
